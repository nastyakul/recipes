DESCRIPTION

This is one of my favorite brunch recipe. Simple and delicious - perfect for a
lazy Sunday morning.

INGREDIENTS

2 eggs
2 slices whole grain bread
creame-cheese (just the normal amount you paste on bread)
1/2 or 1 avocado (depends on the size)
salt and basil (dry or fresh) for topping
quartered tomatoes for serving
1 plastic zip-bag
1 teaspun of any oil

1. Bring a pot of water to boil (use enough water to cover the eggs when they lay 
in the bottom). Pour some oil into a plastic zip-bag so that the egg you're going to crack into it can be removed easily when ready. When the water is boiling, turn down the heat and carefully pu a zip bag in the pot. Boil for 5 minutes. 

2. While the eggs are cooking, toast the bread and, paste some creame cheese and smash the avocado on each piece of toast. When the eggs are done, use a spatula to lift the eggs out of the
water. Gently pull out the egs and remove a plastic bag. Place the poached eggs on top of the toast. Sprinkle with salt and fresh herbs; serve with the fresh quartered tomatoes.
